## Description of incident:

John called me up, advised that the car he was driving for two girls have been involved in an accident while on his way to The National Poetry Library. John's front and side of the car was hit by a Land Rover driven by Sarah. As per John and his witnesses, Sarah came from the other lane going the opposite direction. Sarah lost control and occupied John's lane. The damage to our Toyota Prius is just terrible; this can't be used for our business anymore unless parts have been replaced and the body paint re-done. The hood is badly bent; the whole engine almost exposed. The bumper is dangling, the grill crushed, headlights broken.
